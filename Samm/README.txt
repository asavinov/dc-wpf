README for DataCommander
========================

DataCommander is a next generation tool for self-service analytical data 
integration. It was created with a single mission: simplifying data 
integration, transformation and analysis. By making data manipulations easier 
for non-IT users, DataCommander dramatically shortens the total time for data 
integration, transformation and analysis. DataCommander is a universal "data 
tamer" which radically simplifies analytical data integration and 
transformations for everyone with little or no help from IT.
