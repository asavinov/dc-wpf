
Icons:
Make an .ico file containing multiple sizes. 
At a minimum, you should have the following sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 256x256 
according to the Windows icon visual guidelines: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa511280.aspx
Having a single .ico file will help Windows pick the best size and scale it appropriately depending on the situation 
(application icon, large taskbar, small taskbar, etc.)
